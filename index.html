    <h2>JavaScript Garden</h2>
    <p>JavaScript Garden is a growing collection of documentation about the most quirky parts of the JavaScript programming language. It gives advice to avoid common mistakes and subtle bugs, as well as performance issues and bad practices, that non-expert JavaScript programmers may encounter on their endeavours into the depths of the language.

    JavaScript Garden does not aim to teach you JavaScript. Former knowledge of the language is strongly recommended in order to understand the topics covered in this guide. In order to learn the basics of the language, please head over to the excellent guide on the Mozilla Developer Network.</p>

    <h2>The Prototype</h2>
    <p>JavaScript does not feature a classical inheritance model; instead, it uses a prototypal one.

    While this is often considered to be one of JavaScript's weaknesses, the prototypal inheritance model is in fact more powerful than the classic model. It is, for example, fairly trivial to build a classic model on top of a prototypal model, while the other way around is a far more difficult task.

    JavaScript is the only widely used language that features prototypal inheritance, so it can take time to adjust to the differences between the two models.</p>

    <h2>The Prototype Property</h2>
    <p>While the prototype property is used by the language to build the prototype chains, it is still possible to assign any given value to it. However, primitives will simply get ignored when assigned as a prototype.</p>

    <h2>Performance</h2>
    <p>The lookup time for properties that are high up on the prototype chain can have a negative impact on performance, and this may be significant in code where performance is critical. Additionally, trying to access non-existent properties will always traverse the full prototype chain.

    Also, when iterating over the properties of an object every property that is on the prototype chain will be enumerated.

    Extension of Native Prototypes

    One mis-feature that is often used is to extend Object.prototype or one of the other built in prototypes.

    This technique is called monkey patching and breaks encapsulation. While used by popular frameworks such as Prototype, there is still no good reason for cluttering built-in types with additional non-standard functionality.

    The only good reason for extending a built-in prototype is to backport the features of newer JavaScript engines; for example, Array.forEach.</p

    <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
    <p>It is essential to understand the prototypal inheritance model before writing complex code that makes use of it. Also, be aware of the length of the prototype chains in your code and break them up if necessary to avoid possible performance problems. Further, the native prototypes should never be extended unless it is for the sake of compatibility with newer JavaScript features.</p>
